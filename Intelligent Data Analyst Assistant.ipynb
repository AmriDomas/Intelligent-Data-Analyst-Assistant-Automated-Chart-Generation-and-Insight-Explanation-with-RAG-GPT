    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I built an intelligent data analysis assistant that combines human-like reasoning with data-driven accuracy. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), GPT-4o, and Python data visualization libraries (like Matplotlib and Seaborn), the assistant is capable of understanding user questions, analyzing uploaded datasets (CSV or PDF), generating appropriate visualizations, and delivering meaningful insights all in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can upload structured data such as sales reports or other tabular formats, and the system will automatically:\n",
    " - Detect relevant columns and schema,\n",
    " - Generate one or more visualizations (bar, pie, line, timeseries, scatter, histogram, correlation matrix),\n",
    " - Apply filters and aggregation as needed,\n",
    " - Interpret chart results using custom auto-analysis logic (generate_auto_answer()),\n",
    " - And finally present a concise, human-readable summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the source data is from PDFs, the assistant retrieves and understands natural language passages and generates textual answers using GPT-based language reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assistant mimics how a business analyst would explore data, extract patterns, and communicate findings making it suitable for both business users and data professionals. The result is a powerful tool that enhances productivity, reduces manual work, and showcases the power of combining LLMs with structured data pipelines."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates a fully automated Data Analytics Assistant that integrates:\n",
    "- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for understanding both structured (CSV) and unstructured (PDF) data.\n",
    "- Multi-chart generation with support for various plot types (bar, line, pie, scatter, time series, histogram, and correlation matrix).\n",
    "- Dynamic function calls generated via LLM (GPT-4o) based on user questions and column schema.\n",
    "- A robust fallback mechanism using a custom generate_auto_answer() function to provide reliable and explainable data insights, even without depending entirely on LLM-generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key strengths of the system include:\n",
    "- Flexibility to handle any uploaded dataset regardless of column names or types.\n",
    "- Smart syncing of visualizations with interpretable natural language answers\n",
    "- Compatibility with both quantitative data (CSV) and qualitative text (PDF) in a unified Streamlit interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution reflects not only strong integration of LLM + Data Science + UI, but also real-world considerations such as:\n",
    "- Handling missing columns and schema mismatches.\n",
    "- Producing meaningful insights for business questions.\n",
    "- Ensuring plot and answer coherence across multiple chart types.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ In summary, this portfolio showcases how LLMs can be enhanced with structured logic to build intelligent, general-purpose data assistants—ready for business analytics, automated reporting, or even client-facing dashboards."
